Modeling GDP Growth

I wanted to create a deep learning model that could predict GDP growth for each quarter. This project was intended as practice for LSTM archictecture.
I used google colab to run cells separately. 

I did two versions: one where the test data included the unexpected COVID-19 phase and the validation data contained the 2008 recession, 
and another where COVID-19 was part of the validation data and the 2008 recession was in the test data.
Both options were used to see how training and validation with each would affect the test.
